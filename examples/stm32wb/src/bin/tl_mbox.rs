        How to make this work:

        - Obtain a NUCLEO-STM32WB55 from your preferred supplier.
        - Download and Install STM32CubeProgrammer.
        - Download stm32wb5x_FUS_fw.bin, stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin, and Release_Notes.html from
          gh:STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWB@2234d97/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x
        - Open STM32CubeProgrammer
        - On the right-hand pane, click "firmware upgrade" to upgrade the st-link firmware.
        - Once complete, click connect to connect to the device.
        - On the left hand pane, click the RSS signal icon to open "Firmware Upgrade Services".
        - In the Release_Notes.html, find the memory address that corresponds to your device for the stm32wb5x_FUS_fw.bin file
        - Select that file, the memory address, "verify download", and then "Firmware Upgrade".
        - Once complete, in the Release_Notes.html, find the memory address that corresponds to your device for the
          stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin file. It should not be the same memory address.
        - Select that file, the memory address, "verify download", and then "Firmware Upgrade".
        - Disconnect from the device.
        - In the examples folder for stm32wb, modify the memory.x file to match your target device.
        - Run this example.

        Note: extended stack versions are not supported at this time. Do not attempt to install a stack with "extended" in the name.
